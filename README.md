# wndx::sane
Library of handy handcrafted CMake **modules**, modern CMake **targets**, best practice techniques and sensible defaults.

The main goal of this project is to make it easier to configure other cmake-based projects.

**wndx::sane::dev** target tries to have sensible compilation options/flags common to all cross-platform C++ projects.

As a bonus, repository contains cmake-based multi-platform CI/CD, code formatting configs.

Can be easily used in other projects as a git submodule or as a cmake module.
